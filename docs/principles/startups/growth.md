## Key Priciniples

**Be impatient for growth, but patient for profitability**

Good money vs Bad money: When the winning startegy is not yet clear in the initial stages of a new business, good money from investors needs to be patient for growth, but impatient for profitability. It demands that a new company figures out a viable strategy as fast as possible and entreprenuers don't spend a lot of money in the pursuit of the wrong strategy. Once a profitable and viable way forward has been discovered, entreprenuers should be patient for profitability and impatient for growth.
