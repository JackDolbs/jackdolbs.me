There is one guiding principle for operating at Early stage: find profitable product-market-fit, while keeping your costs as small as possible.


## Be patient for growth, but impatient for profitability

Good money vs Bad money: When the winning startegy is not yet clear in the initial stages of a new business, good money from investors needs to be patient for growth, but impatient for profitability. It demands that a new company figures out a viable strategy as fast as possible and entreprenuers don't spend a lot of money in the pursuit of the wrong strategy. Once a profitable and viable way forward has been discovered, entreprenuers should be patient for profitability and impatient for growth.

The company should be looking for a unit-profitable strategy before moving into a growth stage. Many startups try to start directly at growth stage and skip finding product market fit. This is often not their fault. VC's typically demand it of them. VC has a short fund life and therefore needs their portfolio companies to give them an exit event before the fund closes. Forget the VC. 


## Your first idea **will** be wrong

93% of all companies that ultimately become successful have to abandon their original strategy<sup>2</sup>. Successful companies don't succeed because they have the right strategy and the begining but because they have money left over after the original strategy fails, so that they can try another strategy. 

This is critical. Don't assume your idea *might* fail. *Expect* it to fail.
