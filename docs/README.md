[Blog](/blog/) <br />General writing and opinions.

[Principles](/principles/) <br />Decision making frameworks and mental models. Principles are ways of successfully dealing with reality to get what you want out of life. Inspired by Ray Dalio's Book "Principles". 

[Knowledge](/knowledge/) <br />Richard Fienman famously kept a list of "Things I don't know". This is my own list and zettlekasten - a repository of personal knowledge that I update from time to time when I find interesting links or research a topic. These small changes are like compound interest. I only expect them to be useful and accurate after a lifetime of updates.
