[Blog](/blog/) <br />General writing and opinions.

[Levels](/levels/) <br />Ray Dalio's Book "Principles" outlines ways of dealing with reality to get what you want out of life. I find "Principles" too black and white for decision making frameworks. I prefer to approach mental models in "Levels" where you can start small and build towards a perfect model.

[Knowledge](/knowledge/) <br />Richard Fienman famously kept a list of "Things I don't know". This is my own list and zettlekasten - a repository of personal knowledge that I update from time to time when I find interesting links or research a topic. These small changes are like compound interest. I only expect them to be useful and accurate after a lifetime of updates.
