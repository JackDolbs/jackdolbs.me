In 169AD a Roman emporer, inexperienced in war, looked over the death of 20,000 of his army. Marcus Aurelius' military, seriously depleted from previous seiges, suffering severly from illness, and fighting in unfamiliar terrain, looked sure to concede defeat to the northern Germanic tribes.
In the years that followed that seemingly insurmountable loss, Aurelius would spend hours each night creating a series of personal writings that would serve as a source of guidance and self improvement.  
The collection of writings was entitled _Meditations_ - the orginal title _Ta eis heauton_ literally translating to "thoughts/writings addressed to himself". Nearly two thousand years later, _Meditations_ by Marcus Aurelius is considered one of the greatest works of philosophy, cementing Aurelius' place in a long line of Stoic philosophers.

This site is my own _"Ta eis heauton"_. Maybe you may find it useful - much as I find _Meditations_ useful. Publishing an accumulation of my personal knowledge online serves multiple purposes:

1. __Organisation__: There is a concept in software development called _refactoring_. Refactoring is the process of restructuring the internal software code to make it clearer - it doesn't actually affect the functionality but it helps to create clarity within the code. This blog is a refactoring of my knowledge. It forces me to reorganise my thoughts.
2. __Improvement__: Kaizen
3. __Correction__: This is my personal implementation of _Cunningham's Law_, which states "The best way to get the right answer on the Internet is not to ask a question, it's to post the wrong answer." If you can find logical fault in my thoughts, I encourage you to tell me. You can either submit a pull request on Github (if you know how), or you can message me directly


In case you were wondering, Marcus Aurelius went on to overcome the poor odds he faced by adapting his strategy to suit the Germanic forest in which he fought. Using vexillationes - smaller guerilla type units that increased the mobility of his force - he drove back the invaders and set up fortifications to defend the land from the north.

# Metacognition - Meta learning: 

## How to learn

One morning while I was travelling in Hong Kong, I joined a friend of mine on a beach, throwing a boomerang that he had made. "It's simple to use," he said in his thick Australian accent. "Just hold it in your outstretched arm at a 45 degree angle and throw it at a 45 degree angle the wind."

He demonstrated this, throwing it with a flick of his wrist and then running about 30 meters to the left to catch it (with varying success). Three minutes after this detailed boomerang throwing demonstration he departed for work, leaving me with a boomerang and a full day to practice.

An hour or so later, I hadn't caught a single throw.

I decided that the boomerang may not withstand a full day of collisions into the sand, and given the tropical heat I thought it would be fun to move into the water to practice throwing.

### Transilience

The word transilience means to jump across something (usually geographical). Moving from the sand to the water was an act of learning transileince for me, it was the quantum leap that my boomerang education really required. I waded into the water until I was at waist depth and this changed two things:

1. I could no longer run for the boomerang, so I was forced throw the boomerang so that it would return within a couple of meters of my initial throw
2. I no longer feared that the boomerang would break when it was landing in the water, so I could throw it with complete disregard

No longer was I content throwing it using the 45-degree-45-degree method: I tried throwing it at a 90-degree angle; I tried at different offsets to the wind; I tried throwing it backwards and upside down. Needless to say that most methods were horribly unsuccessful, however as the day progressed, the magnificent human ability for establishing patterns facilitated my slow understanding of the boomerang's behaviour.
I found that I could throw the boomerang at an angle which was the same angle that I faced from the wind; if I faced at a 70-degree offset to the wind, then I should throw the boomerang also at a 70-degree angle.
I adjusted the strength of the throw based on the the angle of the boomerang.
I adjusted the height of the release based on the angle of the wind.
I felt the strength of the wind on my wet arms and could determine the amount of wrist-flick required upon release.

### Mastery

Now, I know that one day of boomerang throwing does not qualify as full mastery in the art of boomerang throwing, however when my friend came back from his day of work I was standing in a stationary position on the beach throwing the boomerang in 40 meter arcs, catching it without moving more than a couple of meters. On that day, I knew exactly how _that_ boomerang, with _that_ wind, would behave.

### A lesson in learning

Analysing the steps I used to achieve the results that I did on that day, I can find the following pattern:

#####Step 1 - Reaffirm the Goal

At first I blindly tried throwing the boomerang as my friend had taught me. I unconsciously believed that was the goal; it wasn't. In fact, neither was the goal to throw the boomerang and catch it without moving.

The goal was to learn how to throw the boomerang. What if I was trying to hit a target downwind from me, at a 70-degree offset? I needed to learn how the boomerang behaved at all angles, with all types of wind.

#####Step 2 - Actively Try to Fail

The term "try to fail" is really a misnomer, because if you are learning something then realistically you have no idea how to do that thing - what you _think_ will work may fail, and what you _think_ will fail may work.
You always carry these preconceptions of what you _think_ will work. Try those too! But then try every other ridiculous idea that you can feasibly comprehend.

In the boomerang example, the preconceptions I carried were the simple lessons that my friend taught me (the 45-degree-45-degree) method. It wasn't until I stepped into the water that I began to actively fail.

##### Step 3: Act

I could have spent all day thinking about the shape of the boomerang and the speed of the wind, however it wasn't until I actually tried to throw the boomerang that I knew how it would fly.

##### Step 4: Analyse

This is the critical step built upon by the two previous steps. It has two important parts: firstly, analysis is of little use without experience (action); secondly, action is of little use without analysis.

If you decide the best way to do something without trying first, you will most likely fail. Even if you succeed, how do you know the method you used is the best method?

However, if you try something without subsequently analysing it, how can you make an improvement? Once again you will not know if your method is the best method.

Using the cyclical steps of acting then analysing, I can ensure that I am not only learning, I am learning the best possible way.

# How to learn Philosophy

Philosophy is dauntingly large. Figuring out how to learn it most quickly is a difficult choice. A brief browse of the internet (specifically [Philosophy Basics](http://www.philosophybasics.com/general_whatis.html)) shows that there are a few general concepts that will need to be understood:

- Types/schools/movements of philosophy
- The main & most well known philosophors
- The division of philosophy into the following groupings:
- Geographical (Eastern / Western etc)
- Chronological
- Topical (branches / doctrine)

### The first steps

However, the acquisition of any detailed knowledge is a simple formula - the critical first steps should always lead down the path of _relevance_. This means I have to find the types of philosophies can be applied to my own daily actions.

Using the proposal above I can skip over the usual "what is philosophy and why should I study it". Before I can know the value of knowledge I need to acquire it.
Having determined what I don't want, I can move on to what I do - I need a type of philosophy that can teach me how to act. My initial assumption is that this will be the most useful path to follow, rivaled perhaps by a philosophy that teaches me how to think. However as the old adage goes - an ounce of doing is worth a pound of theorising, so I will trust the instincts that I should first learn to _do_, and then use these situations to learn how to _think_ (theorise).

### Ethics - the philosophy of doing

Luckily, finding the correct branch of philosophy isn't difficult - the first bullet point on the [link above](http://www.philosophybasics.com/general_whatis.html) tells me that there is a whole branch of philosophy devoted to how people ought to act: ethical/moral philosophy.

### Doing before learning

If I was in school I'm sure that the next step would be to rote learn the various types of ethical philosphy and then try to apply these teachings to various examples. However I [already know this isn't the best learning approach](/the-boomerang-method/).

So how should I learn? In short, I don't know. But I do have a simple enough way to get started. A few days ago I stumbled across a [subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/moraldilemmas) dedicated to asking just the type of morally ambiguous questions designed to stretch the limits of ethical ation. On any given day I can learn one or two schools of moral philosophy and either:

- Apply the knowledge to an already opened question
- Create my own question upon which to apply the knowlege

Adhering to [The Boomerang Method](/the-boomerang-method/), the critical learning step is the analysis that follows the doing. And this is the benefit of Reddit, I can outsource the analysis through others' responses. I imagine they will be even more able telling than my own introspection.

# How do we judge ethical decisions?

Having established that the [best way to learn philosophy is to begin with ethics](/how-to-learn-philosophy/), I can now begin to probe deeper into ethics itself in three steps:

Step 1. Learn the established schools of ethics
Step 2. Apply these schools of philosophy to moral dilemmas
Step 3. Personally analyse the philosophical application (perhaps with the help of other peoples' opinions)

### The Four Fields of Ethics

Wikipedia details 4 fields of ethics:

1. **Descriptive ethics**: What do people think is right?

- **Meta-ethics**: What does "right" even mean?
- **Normative (prescriptive) ethics**: How should people act?
- **Applied ethics**: How do we take moral knowledge and put it into practice? _(which obviously lends itself to step 3 above)_

Although it would seem sensible to by learning various schools of ethics (Normative) which I can then apply, how am I going to analyse the moral decisions unless I know the value of the application? Therefore, I must determine whether meta-ethics or descriptive ethics would be most useful.

### Meta Ethics

> Meta-ethics is the branch of ethics that seeks to understand the nature of ethical properties, statements, attitudes, and judgments.

> Meta-ethics addresses questions such as "What is goodness?" and "How can we tell what is good from what is bad?", seeking to understand the nature of ethical properties and evaluations.

Source: [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-ethics)

We can already see this will be useful for analysing moral dilemmas. It has the ambition of providing a non-biased, scientific approach to judging inherently unjudgable situations.

### Descriptive ethics

> Descriptive ethics is the study of people's beliefs about morality. It is a form of empirical research into the attitudes of individuals or groups of people. What ought to be noted is that culture is generational and not static. Therefore a new generation will come with its own set of morals and that qualifies to be their ethics.

Source: [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descriptive_ethics)

A transient set of criteria based on a group of people's opinions at a given time and place? This doesn't seem like a good yardstick. Although this field of ethics seems about as useful as cosmology in the 11th century, it may later prove a worthwile study. More importantly, it may be a useful application for the study of Meta Ethics. For example, if Meta Ethics is used to determine what is right and wrong then is that conclusion not based on the opinion of a person (or a group of people)?

Having scanned the paths to the summit of Everest, Hillary made a decision, and began with an initial step upwards. I will choose Meta Ethics as my initial step, though the path seems at least as far Sir Edmund's ascent.

### Warm up

Here are some questions worth pondering:

1. Why should I even bother acting ethically?

- What do the words 'good', 'bad', 'right' and 'wrong' mean?
- Are moral judgments universal or relative, of one kind or many kinds?
- How we can know if something is right or wrong, if at all?

Already I have struck upon a question which I should have sought an answer to in the very beginning: Why even bother acting ethically. If I can't answer this then the intellectual persuit of ethics is pretty pointless too.

---

# Why should we act ethically?

### Why should we act?

_"Why should we act ethically?"_ is a pretty difficult question to tackle, so let's warm up with an easier question - **Why should we act?**

When faced with a choice of how to act, we have one of three paths (at a minimum): act one way; act another way; do not act. That was ambiguous; let's clear it up with an example -
If I asked you to make me a sandwhich for lunch, your options would be: make the sandwhich; make something else (like a pizza); do not make anything.

Although the 'do nothing' may seem like inaction, it is really just another form of action; we'll call it _action through inaction_.

We can therefore answer the question "Why should we act?"-
**Once we are _given a choice_, we don't _have a choice_ - we must act, even if that action is inaction.**

Ethics is about the choosing how to act. We may not be able to choose _whether to_ act, but we can certainly choose _how_ to act (i.e. one of the three options in the sandwhich-making example above).

### The actor and the action

Perceptive readers may have picked up something subtle but significant in the question _"Why should we act ethically?"_. The question is composed of a verb (the action) and a noun (the person performing the action). Aside from being good sentence structure, we know that both people and actions are inherently open for judgement. For clarity we can rephrase the question:

**_"Why should we be ethical and why should we act ethically?"_**

We discussed in [The MACI Framework](/maci-framework-motivation-action-consequence-impact), that actions are on the path: Motivation, Action, Consequences, Impacts. We can relate our new question to this framework -

- When judging whether a _person_ is ethical, we must judge their _motivations_.
- When judging whether an _act_ is ethical, we must judge the impact of their _consequences_.

**Is this true? Are we defined by our actions?**
This may seem apparent now that we have separated the question into the actor and the action, however it is not how the majority of society passes judgement. Most of society looks at the consequences of a person's actions and judges the _person_ on those consequences, regardless of their motivations. This cannot be a sound framework for passing judgement; there are too many cases where the motivation and consequences are misaligned, or if the consequences are unknown then an ethical person has only their motivation to use as a moral compass (examined further in the [Ethical Judgement Framework](/the-ethical-judgement-framework).)

In such cases, judging a _person_ by the consequences of their actions is simply _Argumentum ad populum_.

So it seems we are now finally ready to answer the magic question -

### Why should we be ethical and why should we act ethically?

I spent days pondering this question, without any luck. It was like being told to work your ass off, but without having a good reason to live once you retire. We all automatically assume we should act morally, but who stops to ask why?

Finally, with the help of a little research around the web, I began to question the question itself. In reality I was trying to finish this statement:
_"we should we act ethically because ..."_ - But the more correct statement is this:
_"we should we act ethically if ..."_

“Should” is always conditional. It always depends on an “if”.

- I should stop smoking [if I want to be in better health than I am now]
- You should clean up your toys [if you don’t want to be grounded]

Most of the time the conditional clause is omitted, and “should” is expected to stand on its own as a reason[^n]. In each case there is an action (stopping smoking), and a result which we value (health).

So let's try answer the question by splitting it in two, and then add this conditional clause:

1. We should be ethical [if being ethically motivated is valuable]

- We should act ethically [if the resulting consequences are valuable]

Ouch, all that work and it still doesn't answer the question! It does, however give us a clear path -

1. Determine the value of acting ethically by judging the consequences of our actions, and if we think that value is worthwhile then we should act that way.
2. Likewise, determine the value of being an ethical person by judging our motivatation for performing certain actions, and if it is of value, strive to be an ethical person.

# Ethics, an introduction

Philosophy is dauntingly large. Ethics is an accessible (if not simple) branch in which to begin the study of philosophy; it is both relevant and applicable to our daily lives.

Ethics involves systematizing, defending and recommending concepts of right and wrong conduct. It attempts to answer questions like: "is it wrong to have an abortion?".

###### The Four Fields of Ethics

Wikipedia details 4 fields of ethics:

1. **Descriptive ethics**: What do people think is right?

- **Meta-ethics**: What does "right" even mean?
- **Normative (prescriptive) ethics**: How should people act?
- **Applied ethics**: How do we take moral knowledge and put it into practice?

In essence, ethics fulfills two objectives. It gives us:

- A means to discern what is right and wrong (Descriptive, Meta, & Normative ethics)
- A means to apply that judgement to conduct (Applied ethics)

This is not altogether different from any western legal system. There are two facets: the laws (right & wrong); and the judicial system (for example, court procedings). A legal system is really a society's moral framework, but, as rational humans, we shouldn't just rely on society to tell what is ethical.

That is my purpose here; to rationally decide what I believe is ethical, to create my own moral framework. That is my first task at least. Once I have questioned, debated, and argued with myself, I will expand upon my conclusions through the established ethical philosophies.

###Personal Contemplations

Try counting to infinity in your head; you can start at any number you want, just try to reach infinity.

It's pretty tricky right? Let's simplify the task then. Take the number 1 and divide it in half. Now take one of those halves and halve it again. How many times can we continue to do this? An infinite number of times. This tells us that the number 1 is really just another representation of inifinity, a different infinity. So are the numbers 2, 3, 4, and so on.

Applying ethical judgement is like counting to infinity. When we isolate a situation to judge it ethically it looks very much like the number 1 or the number 2; whole, comprehensible. But when that situation is looked at as a fragment of person's entire life, the world's entire history, the universe's entire existence, the clarity initially grasped melts away like candyfloss in hot water. I know this intrinsically before I begin down this path.

The truth of this can be viewed in nature's indifference, an endless series of cause and effect. A meteor hits the planet and thousands of species of dinosaur are obliterated; the settling dust gives rise to countless new species. A tribe over-fishes their local river and many begin to starve and die; the population regulates and the fish grow in number. These events seem tragic when you look at their immediate consequences, but judgement becomes more ambiguous as time expands.

Everything looks smaller from a distance.

---

######First steps

When conducting an experiment of any kind, the critical first step is to ensure that the trial method we use is consistent. For us to test various ethical concepts we have we must have a systematic approach on how to apply them. This, of course, is Applied Ethics.

We stated earlier that Applied Ethics is "a means to apply judgement to conduct". Within this goal alone give us several objectives, several questions to answer:

1. What causes us to act the way we do?
2. Can change our behaviour?
3. Can we use our experience and reasoning to determine our own method of ethical application?

Let's begin trying to answer these in the next article, the [MACI Framework](/maci-framework-motivation-action-consequence-impact/).

---

# The MACI Framework - Motivation, Action, Consequence, Impact

In the previous article [Ethics, an introduction](/ethics-introduction), we concluded with three questions that needed answering:

1. What causes us to act the way we do?
2. Can change our behaviour?
3. Can we use our experience and reasoning to determine our own method of ethical application?

This article is focused on the first question; conduct. We are seeking to find a systematic and consistent approach on how to apply the concepts of "right" and "wrong" to conduct.

######Unconscious judgement
Humans are always judging. Ceasing judgement is as simple as ceasing thinking. We don't necessarily need to act upon our judgements however and we certainly have it within us to modify our judgements. To do this we need to look into the typical framework of unconscious judgement and formulate our own rational ethical framework. The second goal of this article is to begin this task.

---

# The MACI Framework

Every action is performed in the following stages:

1. **Motivation**

- **Action**
- **Consequences**
- **Impacts**

This level of segregation may seem obvious (or unnecessary) but it's important if we're to identify a major fallacy in people's unconscious judgemental behavior. Let's abbreviate the transition above to _the MACI Framework_ and expand upon each step to ensure that it's clear.

- A person's **motivation** precludes any action and is how we decide which action we will take. It's sometimes referred to as intention, and collectively a person's motivations are often labelled as their character.
- An **action** is the physical manifestation of a person's motivations. Collectively, a person's actions are often defined as their behaviour.
- **Consequences** are the effects that result from actions. Consequences always have flow-on consequences, but they may also have precluded the action that a person took. For example, if you ate bacon this morning then at some stage in the recent past a pig was killed. This might still be considered a consequence.
- The **impact** that consequences have are what we _unconsciously_, as humans, _usually_ judge and what we, as ethical and deliberate humans, should judge. To illustrate this let's use the example of climate change. Society is creating record levels of CO<sup>2</sup> through the use of fossil fuels; the rising CO<sup>2</sup> levels are causing an increase in global temperatures and as a result the polar ice caps are melting. The production of CO<sup>2</sup> isn't necessarily worth judging - if humanity suddenly found a way to innocuously consume the excessive CO<sup>2</sup> its production would no longer be a problem. However the _impact_ of the melting ice, such as the possible extinction of polar bear or certain breeds of penguins, _is_ worth judging.

######Lack of information results in poor judgement
This is our first deviation from unconscious judgement. People occasionally pass judgment on consequences and not impacts, and this is usually a case of having only partial information. If I tell you that a woman ran over a dog with her car, you might say "that is terrible!". If I told you it was because she was swerving to avoid a child that ran onto the street you might then say "that is lucky for the child!". We should always try to be well informed before passing judgement, and ensure we only pass judgement on impacts and never consequences.

###Are we defined by our actions?
Consider the following examples:

- A soldier defends the sovereignty and integrity of their nation. If he kills, or gets killed, is it bad?
- A doctor pierces a body with a knife. If the patient dies, is it that also bad? [^n]

It's extremely difficult to to judge a person independently of the actions they perform; motivation is just too difficult to determine. Society likes to pick and choose when to judge a person's motivation and when to judge their actions. In the cases above, the soldier and the surgeon are (generally) praised within society, seemingly because their intentions are contrary to the consequences of their actions. Take a case of manslaughter however, where a person's intentions are also judged to be contrary to the consequences of their actions, but they are nonetheless punished (even if that punishment is reduced). What makes mansluaghter any different to the soldier above, where the soldier is intentionally trying to kill somebody? Is this reasonable or is it simply _Argumentum ad populum_?

######Separating the actor from the action
Let's look at some other cases where motivation and consequences are misaligned:

- A traveller accidently causes offense because of a cultural misunderstanding. Are they culpable if they simply are ignorant of the foreign customs?
- A murderer walks into a bank and shoots 5 people. When he tries to shoot a sixth he finds his gun is out of bullets, so he leaves and the sixth victim's life is spared. Consequently, a person's life is "saved", does that make the action "good"?

These are both cases where motivation and consequence are independent. We can conclude that, in priciple, it's important to separate a person and their actions when forming moral judgements.

This important separation allows us, as ethical people, to take action even when we truly do not know the consequences of our actions; in such cases we have only our motivations to use as a moral compass.

When a person exercises _unconscious judgement_, they are judging a person and their actions as one. If we are to systematically argue ethics, we must separate the actor from the action. Both are open to judgement, but must be judged independently, otherwise there will be logical inconsistencies that cannot be explained without the fallacy of double-standard. **We are not what we _do_. We are what we _intend to do_.**

###The Ethical Judgement Framework
In the introduction we stated that we are attempting to find a reasonable means to apply judgement to conduct. Having now separated the actor from the action, we can reflect this in our original goal by redefining it:
We must find a means to apply judgement to both a person's conduct and to the person themselves. This is the start of our framework.

1. **When judging whether an _act_ is ethical, we must judge the _impact_ of the consequences**

- **When judging whether a _person_ is ethical, we must judge their _motivations_**

Is this framework incomplete? Undoubtably. But at least it gives us some fixed, logical rules upon which to test ethical situations. We can expand this list as we progress through the study of ethics.

Unfortunately, the second rule will be difficult to consistently apply. It is extremely difficult to determine a person's motivation. To judge, and to be judged ourselves, we need to ensure that our motivations are as apparent as the impact of our actions.

# The Ethical Judgement Framework

Must be in complete isolation

Rule 1, ethics can only be judge in isolation.

Are ethics immutable and are they singular across the population? Or are they just a measure of each individual's or society's inner belief?

### Ethical dilemmas

Ponder the following examples.

#### The ambiguously ethical rapist[^n]

A serial rapist sees a woman walking alone at night on the street. He decides to rape her and begins stalking towards her, when all of a sudden a much more attractive woman appears. So instead he rapes her. **With respect to the first woman**, it seems it was ethical in choosing not to rape her. But has he acted ethically if his motivation was to go and rape the other woman?

#### The reluctant carnivore

A girl watches a documentary on the cruel treatment of pigs destined for human consumption. She empathises with the pigs, however she loves eating bacon for breakfast. She decides to keep eating bacon. Is she an immoral person?

#### The healthy man and the unhealthy woman

Imagine the following people: 
- a 25 year old man chooses to get fit, by running around the block every day. 
- an elderly woman loses all her friends and family. Knowing she doesn't have a means to support herself she decides to commit suicide.

Both of these situations appear to have only personal consequences (no impact on other people), however one seems obviously more ethical than the other. Why?

#### The man who blew his nose

A man is travelling in Japan and is eating dinner with some locals. Having picked up a travelling cold, he has a blocked nose and is finding it difficult to converse. The man blows his nose and immediately notices that the local dinner guests seem offended. He assumes that it is impolite to blow your nose at the table in Japan however he did not know that until he did it. Was it unethical?

#### The worst best man

Brian is getting married in a few months and has asked Dave to be his best man. Brian chose to have the wedding on an island, which will be an expensive trip for Dave, too expensive for him to afford. Since Dave cannot attend the wedding, is he an immoral person?

- _The less choice a person has, the more amoral the action_. This shouldn't really be necessary to stipulate, as ethics is about choosing the correct path of action from the choices we have. If we cannot take a perform action, the consequences of action cannot be ours to bear. This ties in nicely with the abortion debate - a baby itself cannot choose if it is aborted, so it is not morally responsible. **At what point does it become NOT OK for abortion? When the baby can make choices?** However as the law stands, currently neither does the mother/father have much coice. For example, they could: break the law; have the baby and raise it in a life of poverty.

Or is it the lack of alternative options? eg, urea leakage into the waterways...

---

The purpose of the article is to discover how to judge ethicall acts. We can use these examples above as the whetstone upon which we will sharpen our arguments.

Let us hypothesize a couple of rules:

**Guidelines for Ethical Judgement**

- When judging whether a _person_ is ethical, we must judge their _motivations_
- When judging whether an _act_ is ethical, we must judge their _consequences_

Using the examples at the start of the article we can test our hypothesis -

**The ambiguously ethical rapist**

- As an isolated _act_, choosing not to rape the first woman appears ethical, the consqeuence being the first woman's continued wellbeing rather than distress. However:
- As the rapist's _motivation_ was to instead rape another woman, it appears he is himself an immoral person.

**CAN WE judge a person by only the motivation of an individual act?**
This fits the guidelines, but they now seem incomplete. The only reason that the man did not rape the first woman was because he raped another. So although we concluded that the isolated act is moral, the man's collective actions appear not to be. Let's try expand the guidelines:

- When judging whether a _person_ is ethical, we must judge their _motivations_
- When judging whether an _act_ is ethical, we must judge their _consequences_
- _Consequences should not be judged in isolation. An action usually have several consequences which should be judged collectively_

**The man who blew his nose**

- The man blew his nose because he wished to converse more easily. His motivation seemed ethical, so he seems like an ethical person. However:
- Blowing his nose caused offense to the local Japanese and so the action itself appears unethical

Once again, this seems to make the guidelines incomplete. How can the man have known the offense he would cause? Let's try make a further ammendment:

- When judging whether a _person_ is ethical, we must judge their _motivations_
- When judging whether an _act_ is ethical, we must judge their _consequences_
- Consequences should not be judged in isolation. An action usually have several consequences which should be judged collectively
- _Motivation is the better indicator of morality if a person is ignorant of the consequences of their actions_

**The reluctant carnivore**

- The act of eating the bacon seems to be immoral, but only now that the girl knows that pigs are treated poorly. When she was ignorant of this fact, eating bacon appears to be "less immoral"
- Her motivation for eating bacon is not to cause them cruelty, it is to cause herself delicious, bacon-y pleasure.

Of course the act of eating the bacon seems immoral, but only now that the girl knows that pigs are treated poorly. When she was ignorant of this fact, eating bacon appears to be "less immoral". This situation was covered with the inclusion of guideline number 4 above. However if the girl is such a moral person, why does she continue to eat the bacon? It seems to be because she derives more pleasure from eating the bacon than from abstaining. After all, how does she know the documentary was true? She isn't directly causing harm to the pig, right? She has to eat; how can she know whether chickens are treated any better?

At first it seems like we could make an addition to the guidlines like so:
_"The less direct influence a person has on the consequences, the more amoral the action"._

But that's not entirely true. Let's use a topical example to explore this clause: global warming. Humans and businesses are clearly contributing to greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, however are each to blame equally? Although they may contribute atmospheric CO2 in different _proportions_, one could argue that they have equally little _influence_ over the issue of global warming. So we have to amend the clause to reflect the impact that each person contributes. A wrothy clause may be:
_When a person has an only indirect influence the consequences, the moral judgement should be in proportion to their contribution to the impact of the consequences_

Using this stipulation, we can say that businesses who contribute more CO2 than people have a greater moral obligation towards reducing their carbon footprint.

For additional clarity, the clause explicitly says _"impact of the consequences"_. When we judge consequences, it is usually the impact of those consequences that we judge. For example, one consequence of increased greenhouse gases is increased global temperatures. The warming itself isn't worth judging, it is the flow-on effects (e.g. melting polar ice caps resulting in polar bear deaths).

Now we have a better framework for judging the bacon eater and the contributer to global warming. In the case of the bacon eater, what is the impact? A pig will definitely die, that is certain. But will her continued consumption cause the extinction of pigs as a species? This possibility is not even feasible; one could argue that her consumption increases the population of pigs as species due to consumer demand.
However, can we say the same of global warming? It is entirely feasible, even if the possibility is remote, that global warming could cause another Ice Age, causing the extinction of a plethora of species. So the impact of contributing to global warming could be considered less ethical than eating bacon.

- When judging whether a _person_ is ethical, we must judge their _motivations_
- When judging whether an _act_ is ethical, we must judge their _consequences_
- Consequences should not be judged in isolation. An action usually have several consequences which should be judged collectively
- When a person is ignorant of the consequences of their actions, motivation is the better indicator of morality
- _When a person has an only indirect influence the consequences, the moral judgement should be in proportion to their contribution to the impact of the consequenses_
