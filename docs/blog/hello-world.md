# Hello World ðŸ‘‹

Itâ€™s been a long time since Iâ€™ve sat down to write. Iâ€™ve missed it. I used to write by trade, but these days, writing is more of a pleasure than work. Writing is essential to formulate cohesive thoughts and consolidate your learning, which is precisely why Iâ€™ve decided to start a new blog.

Iâ€™ve been here before. I built a blog to land one of my first major roles in the Web3 industry. This time, however, my intentions are different. I plan to use this to think about the challenges in my work and strengthen my understanding by passing my thoughts on to others. After all, to master it, you must create an obligation to teach it.

So what am I going to write about? In short, a lot of different things. I donâ€™t want to restrict my focus purely because I want to write about topics that get me excited. If Iâ€™m not excited to write, then I wonâ€™t. That being said, I intend to stick to tech, business, and investing. However, Iâ€™m sure Iâ€™ll occasionally go off on a tangent on philosophy, psychology, and freakishly obscure esoteric health hacks.

I must remain consistent, so Iâ€™ve decided to publicize my writing for the added motive of accountability. I intend on writing weekly. But life will inevitably get in the way sometimes, and Iâ€™ll become aberrantly motivated to write more than usual at other times. Youâ€™ve been warned.

But, my promise to you is this. I will keep my posts as concise and straightforward as possible. If I can deliver a point in 250 words, I will. Iâ€™m both a perfectionist and a procrastinator at heart, but I will try my best to deliver these posts as raw, direct, and fast as possible.

Finally, I wanted to S/O some other incredible blogs by writers far better than myself. If youâ€™re here, then the chances are youâ€™re interested in startups. You will struggle to find better blogs than the ones listed below. Read them.

Theyâ€™ve helped me immensely. Becker can be a little obnoxious if you're not used to his humour, but Sam Ovens is a gold mine of information.
