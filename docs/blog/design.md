Dribbble

## Creating a logo

## Colors

- "Startup blue"

## Fonts

- Symetrical

## Building a landing page

- Hero: 70vh, with a "more" indicator at the bottom

## Using a CSS framework

Choose a "class based" framework. WHerever possible avoid using "locked in" frameworks like ReactStrap. Ideally the code is pure HTML rather than bespoke tags.
