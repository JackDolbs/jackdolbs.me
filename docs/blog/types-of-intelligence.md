# Types of intelligence (Draft)

Purpose of this post is simply to highlight some surpising areas where 'intelligence' crops up.

Not my intention talk about Artificial types, only forms that appear in nature

Not my intention to debate whether these forms of intelligence fit into some person's classical definition of intelligence

Singular

Humans, Dolphins, Dogs, elephants

Distributed

Octopus

Actually Humans! The brain split - Sam HArris waking up, consciousness epilepsy

But als this: Consciousness on-off switch discovered deep in brain | New Scientist

Decentralised

Ant colony

Non-local

Could there be a case made for things like ecosystems etc? How far can you stretch the theory (galaxy/universe) before it breaks down?
