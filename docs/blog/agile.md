# Intro to Agile

> Status: DRAFT

[agilemanifesto.org](https://agilemanifesto.org)

## History

Waterfall (SDLC). The old way of doing it:

- Requirements
- Design
- Develop
- Test
- Deploy
- Maintain

Frequently get to the end of the process and discover 

- The requirements have changed
- The requirements were incorrect in the first place
- The people who initiated the project are gone

## The manifesto

- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to change over following a plan

"Software Is about Developing Knowledge More than Writing Code"

Principles: https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html
