# Why Nations Succeed

As Marc Andreessen points out, it's [Time to Build](https://a16z.com/2020/04/18/its-time-to-build/). His article is full of great solutions to the problems we're facing. 

But I doubt any of the solutions will become a reality, at least not in the US. He's not wrong - it *is* time build. His solutions are well-reasoned and actually quite uplifting. 

But after reading his article, I challenge you with a different set of questions. *Why* do some countries succeed in becoming great? Or alternatively - why do some countries (especially those with massive resources) *fail* to become great? And why do those who are already great eventually lose their greatness?

Not **how**, but **why**? 

Imagine we had the perfect blog post - an exact script for how to pull the world out of this crisis - which we could follow like a recipe. Would we follow that script? No, of course not. But *why not?*

A nation succeeds through change. Change happens through action. Action happens when the decisions which are made are not apposed. Opposition happens sometimes because it's necessary, but usually because of ego. 

I've been thinking for a while about why nations succeed. And I have a theory which, for the sake of this article, I will call **The Identity Theory**.

The Identity Theory is this: 

> A nation's ability to grow is in direct proportion to its ability to leave its past behind.

And not just the bad past, the good past as well. That last part might sound controversial. Logically, we should be able to keep the good and simply improve the bad. Unfortunately, humans are not so logical. When it comes to humans, *identity itself* is bad. But I'm getting ahead of myself. Let's explore some history.

### Germany

At the end of World War II, the German economy was in disarray. 20% of housing was destroyed, food production per-capita had dropped 49%, and industrial output had dropped by one third. Defeated, sanctioned, and ashamed, Germany was a ruined state facing a bleak future.

Less than *80 years later*, Germany is a global economic power. It's the largest in economy in the European Union with 24% of the total EU GDP. Sometimes called The German Economic Miracle (Wirtschaftswunder), most of this German economic turnaround had taken effect by 1989, when the Berlin Wall fell and Germany was once again reunited.

And they didn't just win in terms of economic power. They are the de-facto leader of the EU, and a nation looked upon for guidance and support by other nations.

### France

Let's contrast Germany with France, who have an analogous history, 230 years earlier, with the French Revolution. Heavily in debt from war, the French government started taxing its citizens excessively, causing rebellion. After decades of turmoil the French people would finally throw off their monarchical constraints and provide the world of a model of democracy, established in the ideals of the [Enlightenment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment).

For the past two centuries the French Revolution has inspired movements like abolitionism and the right to vote. 

The values and institutions of the Revolution dominate French politics to this day. And rightly so. They should be proud of their history. But pride has a way of stagnating us. 

Let me first point out that France's economy isn't *that bad*. Their total GDP is 40% lower than Germany, but their GDP per-capita is only 14% lower than Germany's ([2019, wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_European_Union#Economies_of_member_states)).

But what I would like to ask is this: why isn't France's economy even bigger? Their ideas inspired many of the greatest facets of governance we see operating in the world today. Could they not have converted these ideas into greater economic power for their own nation?

### Germany vs France

Now we have the basis for contrast. While historians may be horrified at the over-simplification of my summary, and economists are likely thinking off the *hows*, at this point I'm more curious what the psycologists would offer as an explanation.

I listened recently to a [podcast with Dave Goggins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvWB7B8tXK8). Goggins is a retired Navy SEAL who participated in the infamous [Hell Week](https://www.thebalancecareers.com/seal-training-hell-week-3356097) three times. 

At the age of 24 Goggins saw a TV show about Hell Week and decided that he wanted to join the Navy SEALs. The problem was that he was in the depths of depression, caused by a childhood full of poverty and physical abuse. And to make things worse, he was 48kg (106 pounds) over the required weight, with only 3 months to lose it. 

While it sounds impossible, Goggins lost the weight.  To do this, he literally created a new identity for himself. He was no longer *David Goggins*, he was just *"Goggins"*. His new identity, *Goggins*, "invented this thing called the accountability mirror. … I would look in the mirror and call myself out: 'I’m afraid of this. I’m afraid of that.'". Despite his tortured past, which gave him every justification for quitting, Goggins didn't allow it.

Goggins is retired now retired from the SEALs, but he hasn't stopped. At the age of 45 he is an ultra-distance athlete and former world record holder for the most pull-ups done in 24 hours. He's an author, and motivational speaker.

This is the most impressive thing about Goggins. He's working as hard at 45 as he did at 24. He still "lives each day as if he hasn’t accomplished anything yet." It sounds completely unhealthy, but it does have one side-effect: growth.

Germany is like Goggins. Through whatever mix of shame and destroyed-identity, they managed to leave their war-torn history behind and trasform their frail economy.

France is not like Goggins. They achieved something any nation would be proud of. But they hold tightly to their past. Every new decision gets debated and weighed against the arguments of their philos. 

**A nation's ability to grow is in direct proportion to its ability to leave its past behind.**

A nation succeeds through change. Change happens through action. Action happens when the decisions which are made are not apposed. Opposition happens sometimes because it's necessary, but usually because of ego. 

### USA

The USA is like Goggins at 24. 

240 years ago they reforged their identity and created a nation of greatness. But their identity is their greatest weakness now.  

Americans cling to their political affiliations. They rile against the problems that the opposition made in the past and oppose actions which might give everyone a benefit in the future. Their political system is a zero-sum game, where each party tries to make the other lose so that they can gain power.

And the biggest problem? Theirs is the greatest political system ever practiced. It's uncanny the amount of insight the Founding Fathers had, to produce a system that would inspire a nation into unity and which continue largely-unchanged for centuries.

But it's still just the least-worst option. There are still so many problems that need to be addressed. 

### Conclusion

A nation succeeds through change. Change happens through action. Action happens when the decisions which are made are not apposed. Opposition happens sometimes because it's necessary, but usually because of ego. 

Marc finishes with a challenge:

> Here’s a modest proposal to my critics. Instead of attacking my ideas of what to build, conceive your own! What do you think we should build? There’s an excellent chance I’ll agree with you.

So here is my response to Marc: **Build a nation that can give up it's past.** It's tempting to write another article about the *how's* of a nation's history - how to succeed, how not to fail, what should be done and not done. This is not that article, I'll leave that to economists who are smarter than me. 


##### Notes

- When I say "decisions which are made are not apposed", I don't mean misguided ideas *unapposed*.
