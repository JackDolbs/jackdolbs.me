# Friction Logs

One of the tools that has become most useful at Supabase is a Friction Log. 

At Supabase, we ask every new joiner to spend their first week using building something using the Supabase tools. We also ask them to keep a log of their journey so that the team can read it and improve the Developer Experience for our community.

This is a nice pattern because after you have learned a tool, you can never again see it with "fresh eyes". A friction log gives you a clear insight into what it's like for a new user.

## What is a friction log?

A friction log is essentially a methodical record of user experiences, focusing specifically on difficulties and inefficiencies. It's like mapping out the rough patches in a journey, aiming to smooth them out for a better experience.

Friction logs aren't just about finding faults; they're about building bridges towards better user experiences. By methodically identifying and addressing these issues, we can create smoother, more enjoyable journeys for our users.
## What tool should I use?

Collaboration and clarity are essential. Use something like **Google Docs** and **Notion** - they allow team members to add comments. They are also easy for pasting screenshots.

## Effectiveness

If you're taking the time to write a friction log, you might as well make it useful. Some considerations:

1. **Detail-Oriented:** It's not just about noting the problem but understanding the 'when', 'how', and 'why' of it.
2. **Objectivity:** Personal biases are set aside. The focus is on the issue, providing a clear path to solutions.
3. **Actionable Insights:** The ultimate goal is to offer tangible steps for improvement, turning pain points into lessons.


Some do's and don'ts for a good friction log:

| **Do's**                                 | **Don'ts**                         |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Capture a full range: the awesome, good, bad, and ugly aspects.         | Avoid vague descriptions, like "It didn't work."                     |
| Focus on a specific workflow, driven by a clear use case.               | Refrain from nitpicking, such as color preferences.                  |
| Explain your thought process and expectations at each step.             | Don't just highlight problems; offer insights too.                   |
| Include all errors, both from the product and user perspectives.        | Avoid only praising without identifying improvement areas.           |
| Embrace humility: admit when something is unclear or confusing.         | Don't skip steps in the workflow; each part matters.                 |
| Be concise. Make it easy for the developers to find the problem.                                                                        | Be clear about expectations and desired outcomes.                    |
