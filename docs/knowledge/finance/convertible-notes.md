# Convertible notes

Convertible notes are very common for angel to seed stage companies.

## Possible criteria

**Valuation Cap**

TLDR: A lower valuation cap is better for the investor. 

**Discount**

TLDR: A higher discount is better for the investor.


## Example scenarios

**Valuation Cap Example**

An investor agrees to a convertible note with a 4M valuation cap at seed stage.

- If the startup then raises at a 12M pre-money valuation at Series A, they will be 3x better off than the Series A investor
- If the startup then raises at a 8M pre-money valuation at Series A, they will be 2x better off than the Series A investor
- If the startup then raises at a 4M pre-money valuation at Series A, they will be not better off than the Series A investor
