## Why should we act?

__"Why should we act ethically?"__ is a pretty difficult question to tackle, so let's warm up with an easier question - **"Why should we act?"**

When faced with a choice of how to act, we have one of three paths (at a minimum): act one way; act another way; do not act. 

That was ambiguous so let's clear it up with an example. If I asked you to make me a sandwhich for lunch, your options would be: make the sandwhich; make something else (like a pizza); do not make anything.

Although the 'do nothing' may seem like inaction, it is really just another form of action; we'll call it _action through inaction_.

We can therefore answer the question "Why should we act?"

> Once we are __given a choice__, we don't __have a choice__. We must act, even if that action is inaction.

Ethics is about the choosing how to act. We may not be able to choose _whether to_ act, but we can certainly choose _how_ to act (i.e. one of the three options in the sandwhich-making example above).

### The actor and the action

Perceptive readers may have picked up something subtle but significant in the question _"Why should we act ethically?"_. The question is composed of a verb (the action) and a noun (the person performing the action). Aside from being good sentence structure, we know that both people and actions are inherently open for judgement. For clarity we can rephrase the question:

**_"Why should we be ethical and why should we act ethically?"_**

We discussed in [The MACI Framework](/knowledge/ethics-maci), that actions are on the path: Motivation, Action, Consequences, Impacts. We can relate our new question to this framework -

- When judging whether a _person_ is ethical, we must judge their _motivations_.
- When judging whether an _act_ is ethical, we must judge the impact of their _consequences_.

**Is this true? Are we defined by our actions?**
This may seem apparent now that we have separated the question into the actor and the action, however it is not how the majority of society passes judgement. Most of society looks at the consequences of a person's actions and judges the _person_ on those consequences, regardless of their motivations. This cannot be a sound framework for passing judgement; there are too many cases where the motivation and consequences are misaligned, or if the consequences are unknown then an ethical person has only their motivation to use as a moral compass (examined further in the [Ethical Judgement Framework](/the-ethical-judgement-framework).)

In such cases, judging a _person_ by the consequences of their actions is simply _Argumentum ad populum_.

So it seems we are now finally ready to answer the magic question -

## Why should we be ethical and why should we act ethically?

I spent days pondering this question, without any luck. It was like being told to work your ass off, but without having a good reason to live once you retire. We all automatically assume we should act morally, but who stops to ask why?

Finally, with the help of a little research around the web, I began to question the question itself. In reality I was trying to finish this statement:
_"we should we act ethically because ..."_ - But the more correct statement is this:
_"we should we act ethically if ..."_

“Should” is always conditional. It always depends on an “if”.

- I should stop smoking [if I want to be in better health than I am now]
- You should clean up your toys [if you don’t want to be grounded]

Most of the time the conditional clause is omitted, and “should” is expected to stand on its own as a reason. In each case there is an action (stopping smoking), and a result which we value (health).

So let's try answer the question by splitting it in two, and then add this conditional clause:

1. We should be ethical [if being ethically motivated is valuable]
2. We should act ethically [if the resulting consequences are valuable]

Ouch, all that work and it still doesn't answer the question! It does, however give us a clear path -

1. Determine the value of acting ethically by judging the consequences of our actions, and if we think that value is worthwhile then we should act that way.
2. Likewise, determine the value of being an ethical person by judging our motivatation for performing certain actions, and if it is of value, strive to be an ethical person.
