## Why should we act?

"Why should we act ethically?" is a pretty difficult question, so let's warm up with an easier question - "why should we act?"

When faced with a choice of how to act, we always have options. For example, If I asked you to make me a sandwhich for lunch, your options would be:

- act one way: make the sandwhich
- act another way: make a pizza
- do not act: don't make anything

Although the 'do nothing' may seem like inaction, it is really just another form of action.

We can therefore answer the question "Why should we act?"

> Once we are **given a choice**, we don't **have a choice**. We must act, even if that action is inaction.

Ethics is about the choosing how to act. We may not be able to choose _whether to_ act, but we can certainly choose _how_ to act (i.e. one of the three options in the sandwhich-making example above).

### The actor and the action

The question "why should we act ethically?" is composed of a verb (the action) and a noun (the person performing the action). We can actually separate these two things an judge each of them on their ethical merit. For further clarity we can rephrase the question:

- Why should we be ethical and *(person)*
- why should we act ethically  *(act)*

We discussed in [The MACI Framework](/knowledge/ethics-maci), that actions are on the path: Motivation, Action, Consequences, Impacts. We can relate our new question to this framework -

- When judging whether a _person_ is ethical, we must judge their _motivations_.
- When judging whether an _act_ is ethical, we must judge the impact of their _consequences_.

Society generally looks at the consequences of a person's actions and judges the _person_ on those consequences, regardless of their motivations. This cannot be a sound framework for passing judgement; there are too many cases where the motivation and consequences are misaligned. If the consequences are unknown then an ethical person has only their motivation to use as a moral compass.

## Why should we be ethical and why should we act ethically?

“Should” is always conditional. It always depends on an “if”.

- I should stop smoking [if I want to be in better health than I am now]
- You should clean up your toys [if you don’t want to be grounded]

Most of the time the conditional clause is omitted, and “should” is expected to stand on its own as a reason. In each case there is an action (stopping smoking), and a result which we value (health).

So let's try answer the question by splitting it in two, and then add this conditional clause:

1. We should be ethical [if being ethically motivated is valuable]
2. We should act ethically [if the resulting consequences are valuable]
