# Climbing


## Terminology

- Dynamic climbing: lots of jumping around
- Static climbing: smooth, precise movements

### Holds

- Jugs: Massive handlholds that you can grip completely
- Pinchers: flatter handholds that require you to hold hard with your thumb
- Crimps: tiny holds that you can only fit your fingers on
- Sloper: big spherical grabs that you have to hold with open palms.  
- slots and pockets
- 
## Tips

- Keep you arms straight to save energy
- Try not to constantly readjust, be deliberate about your grabs and movements
- Body position: flagging. When you reach up and right, balance by putting your left foot down and left. Basically you want to be stretched out to keep balanced

### Grip

- Don't grip too tight. Only use as much pressure as you need.
- 
### Footwork

- Use your toes, not the middle of your feet
- When the toehold seems tenuous, you should counterintuitively [add your weight](https://youtu.be/7jsUxDVlTOg?t=121) to it. This will increase friction and make the toehold more secure
- Put your toes right into the wall. It helps to start your toes above the toehold and then [come down onto the hold](https://youtu.be/7jsUxDVlTOg?t=299)

## Grips

- Slopers
  - These are easier when you "hang down" and keep your weight below them. As soon as you become level with them they are harder to hold.
  - Cover as much as possible [with your hand](https://youtu.be/ACHNDCjexUU?t=170)
  - don't pull too hard on them you will loose grip. Keep your arms straight and just hang your body weight
