## Tips

These are general rules that can often be ignored. They are only for guidance. In each section I try to roughly order the items by priority.

**General**

- Control the center
- Trade when you are up material
- Trade pieces to make the king move before castling
- Capture towards the center (except in the endgame)
- Always take an opportunity to check

**Openings**

- Don't touch the same piece twice
- Knights before bishops
- Develop bishops before closing the gap with your pawns
- Don't bring your queen out too early

**Pawns**

- Try to keep your pawns in islands (connected), rather than isolated 

**Knights**

- Keep knights away from the sides
- Knights are best (compared to bishops) when the play is on one side of the board

**Bishops**

- Bishops are best (compared to knights) when the play is on both sides of the board

**Rooks**

- Control open files
- Connect your rooks and double on open files
- Put rooks behind pass pawns

**King**

- Centralise your king in the endgame
