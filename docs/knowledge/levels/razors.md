# Razors

A "razor" is a rule of thumb or principle that allows for simplified decision-making by cutting through complexity. It's used to make quicker, often more effective judgments based on limited information. The term originates from "Occam's Razor," a principle suggesting the simplest explanation is usually the correct one.
