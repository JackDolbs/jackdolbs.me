# The Four Noble Truths

Outline of the four truths

> 1. There is suffering, and it is universal
> 2. There is a cause of this suffering
> 3. There is a way to end this suffering
> 4. The way out of suffering - a way for us to live

Not absolute truths - there cannot be absolute suffering if there is also a cessation of suffering

## The format of each truth

Each of these statements have 3 aspects to them: 

1. Accepting/acknowledging whether it is true. Eg. is there suffering?
2. Accepting that we should understand the truth, not just take it on blind faith or ignore it. Eg: One should understand suffering, not just try to get rid of it.
3. Accepting/acknowledging the cause. Yes, there is suffering and I understand what that suffering is.

Interpreted:

1. Testing the validity of the truth
2. Affirming that the truth needs to be understood, not just witnessed
3. Understanding the truth

Although each is very nuanced and can be probed for there depth, I will not spend time on each of these if they seem self evident (for example, is there suffering?). 

Also peculiar how different truths will resonate with different people. Early on I focused heavily on the fourth truth, wanting to just follow the path. Now I am much more drawn to the third. No matter what, if any of them strike you as interesting then go away study them - think about them hard, write about them, read about them. Each has unfathomable depth, they are a lifetime of study.

## First truth: there is suffering

Test the validity. Is there suffering? And Why does it need to be understood?

Doesn't need to be detailed

stand under or embrace it rather than just react to it. With any form of suffering - physical or mental - we usually just react, but with understanding we can really look at suffering; really accept it, really hold it and embrace it.

#### Understanding

Forms of suffering: suffering, unsatisfying, unreliable

Dukkha, the Pali word commonly translated as "suffering", has a few addtional qualities beyond just suffering.

It also has the qualities of being unsatisfying or unreliable. These qualities make the term more universally applicable - especially in cases that are pleasurable. 

It's not apparent that pleasurable experiences can manifest suffering until you have a strong understanding of how impermanent they are. All experiences that are pleasurable will pass, transform, or change. They are therefore eventually and ultimately unsatisfying.

There is also little we can do to recreate pleasurable experiences in the same way and with the same intensity. The pleasure that we derive from an experience will be different or diminished, even if we go through the same process to recreate that experience (if we are able to recreate it at all). All experiences are also therefore unreliable.

## Second truth: there is a cause of suffering

Test: is there a cause? and Why do we need to acknowledge the cause?

What is the cause.

 attachment (or Impermanence?)

## Third Truth: Cessation of Suffering

Doesn't need to be a far-off goal, can be recognised throughout the day and practiced. In this way, it is not a "stepping stone" that needs to be conquered before
