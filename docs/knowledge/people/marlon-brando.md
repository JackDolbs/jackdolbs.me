# Marlon Brando

Marlon Brando could be the most real human to have risen to the heights of society. Which is ironic since he was an actor, spending much of his career pretending to be someone else. 
Take this response to Connie Chung's interview question in 1989, *"Don't you realise that you're thought of as one of the greatest actors ever?"*:

> *That's part of the sickness in America. You have to think in terms of who wins, who loses, who's good, who's bad, who's best, who's worst. 
> We always think in those terms, in the extreme terms. I don't like to think that way.*

Imagine someone telling you that you are the greatest actor who ever lived, and you genuinely don't care. It must be liberating.

When we put such an emphasis on being the best, it devalues the things we previously achieved. If Brando wins another Gold Globe, then what? _How many Golden Globes can he win_? _What if his next movie is a flop?_ Brando avoids the "sickness", simply by choosing not to participate in a losing game.

There's another small insight from the clip above: 


> *Everybody has their own value in a different way, and I don't like to think who was the best. What's the point of it?*
> 
> <small>*Marlon Brando*</small>

Any form of comparison creates a heirarchy: "me better, you worse". It's a zero-sum mental model. Even as uniquely talented actor, Brando recognizes the value of every human. It's an incredibly wholesome belief system.

It's rare for someone as famous as Brando to embody such an egoless mindset. This is his response when the interviewer persists in speaking to him on these terms:

> <small>*Connie Chung*:</small>
> 
> "You must realise that any producer or director is dying to work with Maron Brando?"
> 
> <small>*Marlon Brando*:</small>
> 
> "Don't speak to me as 'Marlon Brendo' as though I were some person hiding under a firetruck down the road. I hate it."

She gives him the "role" of an idol and he immediately turns it down, demanding instead that she treat him like a regular human.

It's difficult to turn down a role which most of society values. There's probably a good reason for that: over the last 200,000 years of societal adaptation our status has been synonymous with survival.
Status is a virtuous cycle (using the term "virtuous" unironically): the more powerful we are *perceived* to be, the more status we're [given by others](/knowledge/mimetic-theory.html#metaphysical-desire). And so when we gain some status it's natural to use it to gain more. 

it would be easy here for Brando to use his fame to gain more status within the entertainment industry. But he appears to value authenticity as the highest form of status, and this doesn't align with society's hierarchy of values. Take this clip, where he points to the absurdity of the interview process he's participating in:

> "There's something idiotic about us sitting here and pretending to talk to one another when there's a camera right there.
> And we're pretending to have an intimate conversation. That's an act."

Imagine how hard this would be for an actor, when all of society is rewarding you for position. Somehow, Brando managed to separate himself from the role his profession imposed on him. 

Brando doesn't want to be a court jester, spending his life attempting to fulfil other peoples expectations of him. Even when the interviewer occasionally grasps his mental framework, it's difficult for her to reconcile:

> [at 30s *"Do you think you owe anything to ..... aggghhh nah you don't. Right?"*
> 
> <small>*Connie Chung*</small>

And Brando reinforces how little he values the entertainment industry: *"In the kingdom of the blind, the man with one eye is the king."*
Quite simply, he believes that society values the wrong thing.

Brando is a contemplative man. This interview happened after a 9-year gap in between movies. He spent that time thinking about what matters in life. 
He alludes to some things in the clip above, like a Rembrandt painting or Mozart's music. In other clips he holds an absurdist viewpoint: he wants to live an authentic life, engaging more fully with the present moment. 

See the pleasure he gets at the end of this clip from eliciting some authenticity in the interviewer, "the real Connie Chung":

*"It doesn't make much difference whether you're fat or thin in life. It's just if you're a good person"* he says facetiously, then chuckling at his own joke while smelling a pink flower that he's twirling in his fingers. That's one of the most vivid examples of absurdism I think I've ever seen.

I was too young to watch this interview when it came out in 1989, but a Reddit comment gave some insight into how it was received:

> *I'm old enough to remember this and you're right, these were wise words. But people back then thought Brando had gone off the deep end.*<sup>**</sup>

I don't know much about Marlon Brando outside of this interview. He certainly seems eccentric. But he is also a man of integrity, and I can't think of a more important trait for someone in such an influential position in society.
