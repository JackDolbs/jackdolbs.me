# Introduction to Ethics

Here are some questions worth pondering:

- Why should I even bother acting ethically?
- What do the words 'good', 'bad', 'right' and 'wrong' mean?
- Are moral judgments universal or relative, of one kind or many kinds?
- How we can know if something is right or wrong, if at all?

Ethics involves systematizing, defending and recommending concepts of right and wrong conduct. It attempts to answer questions like: "is it wrong to have an abortion?".

In essence, ethics fulfills two objectives. It gives us:

- A means to discern what is right and wrong (Descriptive, Meta, & Normative ethics)
- A means to apply that judgement to conduct (Applied ethics)

This is not altogether different from any western legal system. There are two facets: the laws (right & wrong); and the judicial system (for example, court procedings). A legal system is really a society's moral framework, but, as rational humans, we shouldn't just rely on society to tell what is ethical.


## The Four Fields of Ethics

Wikipedia details 4 fields of ethics:

1. **Meta-ethics**: What does "right" even mean?
1. **Descriptive ethics**: What do people think is right?
1. **Normative (prescriptive) ethics**: How should people act?
1. **Applied ethics**: How do we take moral knowledge and put it into practice? 

## Meta Ethics

> Meta-ethics is the branch of ethics that seeks to understand the nature of ethical properties, statements, attitudes, and judgments. It addresses questions such as "What is goodness?" and "How can we tell what is good from what is bad?", seeking to understand the nature of ethical properties and evaluations.

This field is useful for analysing moral dilemmas. It has the ambition of providing a non-biased, scientific approach to judging inherently unjudgable situations.

## Descriptive ethics

> Descriptive ethics is the study of people's beliefs about morality. It is a form of empirical research into the attitudes of individuals or groups of people. What ought to be noted is that culture is generational and not static. Therefore a new generation will come with its own set of morals and that qualifies to be their ethics.

A transient set of criteria based on a group of people's opinions at a given time and place? This doesn't seem like a good imperitave yardstick. Although this field of ethics seems about as useful as cosmology in the 11th century, it may later prove a worthwile study. More importantly, it may be a useful application for the study of Meta Ethics. For example, if Meta Ethics is used to determine what is right and wrong then is that conclusion not based on the opinion of a person (or a group of people)?
