# Lisp

It's said that learning lisp makes you a better programmer, even if you don't use it day to day. This post will likely span over several years as I continue to passively learn list. I don't plan to write much about lisp itself, but rather give a chronological history of the resources I found useful. 

## Progress: inspired

I don't have a whole history of the reasons why I want to learn lisp. Most of all it's from comments I see on HackerNews. Here are some other things that persuaded me that lisp is worth learning. 

- [Blog] [Beating the Averages](http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html) by Paul Graham
- [Video] [Lisp, The Quantum Programmer's Choice - Computerphile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svmPz5oxMlI) 


## Progress: noob

- I started reading the book *The Little Schemer*, which is highly recommended across the internet. I decided that it would be more helpful to learn a bit of lisp syntax first (`car`?, `cdr`?).
- I watched this [Scheme Lisp: Feel the Cool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tA1clbGDczI) by Andy Balaam on YouTube. I've never learned programming from videos, but actually I found this really helpful.
