> WARNING: This is still in draft

## Preamble

Completely secular. I'm writing this because I couldn't find anthing that was secular. I will try to focus on the phychological aspects

Very little use of Pali words. While this makes it more approachable, it also makes it less accurate. There are nuances that will be missed because of this

I am not an expert, and I have no authority to write this book. Assess it on the merit of the information it contains. Knowledge is not a "first, do no harm" domain. It's absolutely fine to read this with a skeptical mind. THere have been many books that I have read which have helped me to level up, and which if I re-read now I know to be innaccurate. At the time though, the knowledge was exactly what I needed. 


## Introduction

Where did they come from and should they be believed

Came from Buddha, just a man called Siddhartha Gautama in what is now Nepal, in the 6th century B.C. The term buddha means "enlightened one", and once again to keep this text as secular as possible I will not use the term, instead opting for Guatama whenever I refer to him. 

This is very much in the teaching of Guatam himself, who said "...don’t go by reports, by legends, by traditions, by scripture, by logical conjecture, by inference, by analogies, by agreement through pondering views, by probability, or by the thought, ‘This contemplative is our teacher.’"

Scholars agree that he lived

Some historical events in his life are debatable and so I will avoid talking much about him. His father was either a type of King or an elected chieftain of a a small republic or oligarch. So he was born into immense wealth.

Lived as an ascetic and searched for enlightenment. It is said that he grew up in absolute luxury and was sheltered from all suffering, but one day after witnessing an old man he left to become an ascetic. 

For may years he lived on barely any food and no luxury

Eventually he gave up and, determined to find the way out of suffering, he resolved to sit under a bodhi and meditate until he knew the path. 

The four noble truths was the first lesson that he taught, and the fundamental tenet of Buddhism

Should any of this be believed

"When you know for yourselves that, ‘These qualities are skillful; these qualities are blameless; these qualities are praised by the wise; these qualities, when adopted & carried out, lead to welfare & to happiness’ — then you should enter & remain in them.” - Guatama
