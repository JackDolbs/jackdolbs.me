### Basic/Interesting question to solve:

The diameter of earth is 12,756 km. Now that we know that:

- What is the circumference of Earth at the equator?
- What is the circumference of Earth at the 42nd latitude?
- What's the volume of earth?
- What's the surface area?
- A plane travels at 900km per hour 
  - how long does it take to fly from top to bottom? 
  - It flies at 12.7km from the surface. How long now?
  - It has acceleration of 1 m/s^2. How long now?
- Calculate the volume of each:
  - 0–35km 	Crust
  - 35–2,890km 	Mantle
  - 2,890–5,150km Outer core
  - 5,150–6,360km	Inner core 

Gravity
- How much gravitational force does the moon have on the earth?
- How much does the sun have?
- What are the tides different? Earth friction? Positioning of moon + sun? Natural dissonance of tides compounding?

Relativity
- I am standing at a clock tower (hint: twin paradox)
  - I travel for 1 hour at the speed of light away from the clock. I look at my watch. What is the time on my watch? I look at the clock. What is the time on the clock?
  - I travel for 1 hour at the speed of light back to the clock. I look at my watch. What is the time on my watch? I look at the clock. What is the time on the clock?



## Interesting concepts

### Boltzman brain

In theoretical physics, the Boltzmann brain hypothesis suggests that our entire universe could have emerged as a random, momentary fluctuation in a high-entropy state. 

Imagine that the reality you perceive, including the past you remember, might be nothing more than a fleeting momentary construct, like a Boltzmann brain that forms briefly and then vanishes. As you read this, you think that you are a human, with a past and a future. But what if these "memories" and this "sense of self" is simply a random event that makes you _feel_ like you are a long-living entity. Consider that in the next moment, your entire existence might dissolve into the randomness from which it emerged.
