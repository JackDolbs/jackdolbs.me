  - Which metrics around cost, efficiency or business do you need to achieve?
  - How would this success be measured by business?

  - How is this put in sequential order and on which timeline is it based?
  - How does the approval process look like for $100K, $500K or $1 million?
  - Paper: How is the legal construct set up? Are there frame agreements in place? What are the critical mandatory terms and conditions? Which contractual paperwork is the basis of negotiation?

## Mental models

**Not sales, consulting**

When you think of salespeople they are generally people without my best interests at heart. They’re trying to close the deal. They don’t really know or care about the things I want. Great sales isn’t about closing the deal, it starts with understanding the customer. Think of yourself as a consultant or a trusted advisor. You’re trying to help the customer get the outcome they want (and maybe that’s not buying your product).




## Hiring

The easiest way to get into B2B sales is to hire an experienced Head of Sales. This person should have had experience in the past growing a sales team from scratch, putting in place incentive structures etc.

## Team Dynamic

In technical sales, you should split the sales into a dual approach: a sales person, and a solution architect.
