# Marcus Aurelius 

In 169AD a Roman emporer, inexperienced in war, looked over the death of 20,000 of his army. Marcus Aurelius' military, seriously depleted from previous seiges, suffering severly from illness, and fighting in unfamiliar terrain, looked sure to concede defeat to the northern Germanic tribes.

In the years following that seemingly insurmountable loss, Aurelius would spend hours each night creating a series of personal writings that would serve as a source of guidance and self improvement.  

The collection of writings was entitled _Meditations_ - the orginal title _"Ta eis heauton"_ literally translating to "thoughts/writings addressed to himself". Nearly two thousand years later, _Meditations_ by Marcus Aurelius is considered one of the greatest works of philosophy, cementing Aurelius' place in a long line of Stoic philosophers.

Marcus Aurelius went on to overcome the poor odds he faced by adapting his strategy to suit the Germanic forest in which he fought. Using vexillationes - smaller guerilla type units that increased the mobility of his force - he drove back the invaders and set up fortifications to defend the land from the north.
