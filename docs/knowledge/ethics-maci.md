# The MACI Framework 

> Motivation, Action, Consequence, Impact

Consider the following

1. What causes us to act the way we do?
2. Can change our behaviour?
3. Can we use our experience and reasoning to determine our own method of ethical application?

This article is focused on the first question; conduct. We are seeking to find a systematic and consistent approach on how to apply the concepts of "right" and "wrong" to conduct.

## Unconscious judgement
Humans are always judging. Ceasing judgement is as simple as ceasing thinking. We don't necessarily need to act upon our judgements however and we certainly have it within us to modify our judgements. To do this we need to look into the typical framework of unconscious judgement and formulate our own rational ethical framework. The second goal of this article is to begin this task.


# The MACI Framework

Every action is performed in the following stages:

1. **Motivation**
1. **Action**
1. **Consequences**
1. **Impacts**

This level of segregation may seem obvious (or unnecessary) but it's important if we're to identify a major fallacy in people's unconscious judgemental behavior. Let's abbreviate the transition above to _the MACI Framework_ and expand upon each step to ensure that it's clear.

- A person's **motivation** precludes any action and is how we decide which action we will take. It's sometimes referred to as intention, and collectively a person's motivations are often labelled as their character.
- An **action** is the physical manifestation of a person's motivations. Collectively, a person's actions are often defined as their behaviour.
- **Consequences** are the effects that result from actions. Consequences always have flow-on consequences, but they may also have precluded the action that a person took. For example, if you ate bacon this morning then at some stage in the recent past a pig was killed. This might still be considered a consequence.
- The **impact** that consequences have are what we _unconsciously_, as humans, _usually_ judge and what we, as ethical and deliberate humans, should judge. To illustrate this let's use the example of climate change. Society is creating record levels of CO<sup>2</sup> through the use of fossil fuels; the rising CO<sup>2</sup> levels are causing an increase in global temperatures and as a result the polar ice caps are melting. The production of CO<sup>2</sup> isn't necessarily worth judging - if humanity suddenly found a way to innocuously consume the excessive CO<sup>2</sup> its production would no longer be a problem. However the _impact_ of the increase CO<sup>2</sup> is causing melting ice, which could cause the extinction of polar bears or certain breeds of penguins. This _is_ worth judging.

## Lack of information results in poor judgement
This is our first deviation from unconscious judgement. People occasionally pass judgment on consequences and not impacts, and this is usually a case of having only partial information. If I tell you that a woman ran over a dog with her car, you might say "that is terrible!". If I told you it was because she was swerving to avoid a child that ran onto the street you might then say "that is lucky for the child!". We should always try to be well informed before passing judgement, and ensure we only pass judgement on impacts and never consequences.

## Are we defined by our actions?
Consider the following examples:

- A soldier defends the sovereignty and integrity of their nation. If he kills, or gets killed, is it bad?
- A doctor pierces a body with a knife. If the patient dies, is it that also bad? 

It's extremely difficult to to judge a person independently of the actions they perform; motivation is just too difficult to determine. Society likes to pick and choose when to judge a person's motivation and when to judge their actions. In the cases above, the soldier and the surgeon are (generally) praised within society, seemingly because their intentions are contrary to the consequences of their actions. Take a case of manslaughter however, where a person's intentions are also judged to be contrary to the consequences of their actions, but they are nonetheless punished (even if that punishment is reduced). What makes mansluaghter any different to the soldier above, where the soldier is intentionally trying to kill somebody? Is this reasonable or is it simply _Argumentum ad populum_?

## Separating the actor from the action
Let's look at some other cases where motivation and consequences are misaligned:

- A traveller accidently causes offense because of a cultural misunderstanding. Are they culpable if they simply are ignorant of the foreign customs?
- A murderer walks into a bank and shoots 5 people. When he tries to shoot a sixth he finds his gun is out of bullets, so he leaves and the sixth victim's life is spared. Consequently, a person's life is "saved", does that make the action "good"?

These are both cases where motivation and consequence are independent. We can conclude that, in priciple, it's important to separate a person and their actions when forming moral judgements.

This important separation allows us, as ethical people, to take action even when we truly do not know the consequences of our actions; in such cases we have only our motivations to use as a moral compass.

When a person exercises _unconscious judgement_, they are judging a person and their actions as one. If we are to systematically argue ethics, we must separate the actor from the action. Both are open to judgement, but must be judged independently, otherwise there will be logical inconsistencies that cannot be explained without the fallacy of double-standard. **We are not what we _do_. We are what we _intend to do_.**

## The Ethical Judgement Framework
My task is to find a reasonable means to apply judgement to conduct. Having now separated the actor from the action, I can reflect this in my original goal by redefining it: we must find a means to apply judgement to both a person's conduct and to the person themselves. This is the start of our framework.

1. **When judging whether an _act_ is ethical, we must judge the _impact_ of the consequences**
2. **When judging whether a _person_ is ethical, we must judge their _motivations_**

Is this framework incomplete? Yes. 

For example, the second rule will be difficult to consistently apply. It is extremely difficult to determine a person's motivation. To judge, and to be judged ourselves, we need to ensure that our motivations are as apparent as the impact of our actions.

But at least it gives us some fixed, logical rules upon which to test ethical situations. We can expand this list as we progress through the study of ethics.
