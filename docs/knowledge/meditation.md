## Panna & Vipassana

**Panna/anna**

is increasing the awareness of all the different aspects of something

**Vipassana**  

"Vipassana is derived from two roots. Vi is a prefix with a complex set of connotations. Passana means seeing or perceiving. The basic meaning is “seeing in a special way.” But there also is the connotation of both “into” and “through.” The whole meaning of the word is looking into something with clarity and precision, seeing each component as distinct, and piercing all the way through so as to perceive the most fundamental reality of that thing.” > Bhanthe Gunaratana

**Analogy**

I am aware of the field of Machine Learning. I understand how the field works and can be used within the broader technology solution. This is Panna
However I would not be able to build a RNN from scratch. I know that I might need back-propogation and I know I would have nodes with weightings, but how would I go about implementing this? What are all the other parts that I do not know about - the unknown unknowns?

This is the same as the scholar who spends their time learning the terms, studying the fields, but then never applying their knowledge. They may not fully comprehend the reasons why things are as they are.

Richard Feynman would perhaps have full Vipassana in the field of the mathematics of phsyics. He understood how the world worked, could break it down and reconstruct it in different areas.
