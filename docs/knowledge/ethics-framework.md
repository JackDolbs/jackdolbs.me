# The Ethical Judgement Framework

> WARNING: This is still in draft

The purpose of the article is to discover how to judge ethical acts, starting with our previous rules:

> 1. When judging whether a _person_ is ethical, we must judge their _motivations_
> 1. When judging whether an _act_ is ethical, we must judge their _consequences_

Are ethics immutable and are they universal? Or are they just a measure of each individual's or society's inner belief? Sam Harris has a concept of a Moral Landscape, whereby there are many different "peaks" of wellbeing. Although I believe this is correct, I am going to posit a framework which may live in a vacuum. As you follow the causal chain of motivation and consequence, the framework will break down. Conversely, if you look at any acts or motivations in isolation, then judgement is going to be incomplete.


We can test our framework through a series of ethical dilimmas. Ponder the following examples.

## The ambiguously ethical rapist

A serial rapist sees a woman walking alone at night on the street. He decides to rape her and begins stalking towards her, when all of a sudden a much more attractive woman appears. So instead he rapes her. **With respect to the first woman**, it seems it was ethical in choosing not to rape her. But has he acted ethically if his motivation was to go and rape the other woman?

- As an isolated _act_, choosing not to rape the first woman appears ethical, the consqeuence being the first woman's continued wellbeing rather than distress. However:
- As the rapist's _motivation_ was to instead rape another woman, it appears he is himself an immoral person.

Can we judge a person by only the motivation of an individual act? This fits the guidelines, but they now seem incomplete. The only reason that the man did not rape the first woman was because he raped another. So although we concluded that the isolated act is moral, the man's collective actions appear not to be. Let's try expand the guidelines:

> 1. When judging whether a _person_ is ethical, we must judge their _motivations_
> 1. When judging whether an _act_ is ethical, we must judge their _consequences_
> 1. _Consequences should not be judged in isolation. An action usually have several consequences which should be judged collectively_


## The man who blew his nose

A man is travelling in Japan and is eating dinner with some locals. Having picked up a travelling cold, he has a blocked nose and is finding it difficult to converse. The man blows his nose and immediately notices that the local dinner guests seem offended. He assumes that it is impolite to blow your nose at the table in Japan however he did not know that until he did it. Was it unethical?

- The man blew his nose because he wished to converse more easily. His motivation seemed ethical, so he seems like an ethical person. However:
- Blowing his nose caused offense to the local Japanese and so the action itself appears unethical

Once again, this seems to make the guidelines incomplete. How can the man have known the offense he would cause? Let's try make a further ammendment:

> 1. When judging whether a _person_ is ethical, we must judge their _motivations_
> 1. When judging whether an _act_ is ethical, we must judge their _consequences_
> 1. Consequences should not be judged in isolation. An action usually have several consequences which should be judged collectively
> 1. _Motivation is the better indicator of morality if a person is ignorant of the consequences of their actions_


## The reluctant carnivore

A girl watches a documentary on the cruel treatment of pigs destined for human consumption. She empathises with the pigs, however she loves eating bacon for breakfast. She decides to keep eating bacon. Is she an immoral person?

- The act of eating the bacon seems to be immoral, but only now that the girl knows that pigs are treated poorly. When she was ignorant of this fact, eating bacon appears to be "less immoral"
- Her motivation for eating bacon is not to cause them cruelty, it is to cause herself delicious, bacon-y pleasure.

Of course the act of eating the bacon seems immoral, but only now that the girl knows that pigs are treated poorly. When she was ignorant of this fact, eating bacon appears to be "less immoral". This situation was covered with the inclusion of guideline number 4 above. However if the girl is such a moral person, why does she continue to eat the bacon? It seems to be because she derives more pleasure from eating the bacon than from abstaining. After all, how does she know the documentary was true? She isn't directly causing harm to the pig, right? She has to eat; how can she know whether chickens are treated any better?

At first it seems like we could make an addition to the guidlines like so:
_"The less direct influence a person has on the consequences, the more amoral the action"._

But that's not entirely true. Let's use a topical example to explore this clause: global warming. Humans and businesses are clearly contributing to greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, however are each to blame equally? Although they may contribute atmospheric CO2 in different _proportions_, one could argue that they have equally little _influence_ over the issue of global warming. So we have to amend the clause to reflect the impact that each person contributes. A wrothy clause may be:
_When a person has an only indirect influence the consequences, the moral judgement should be in proportion to their contribution to the impact of the consequences_

Using this stipulation, we can say that businesses who contribute more CO2 than people have a greater moral obligation towards reducing their carbon footprint.

For additional clarity, the clause explicitly says _"impact of the consequences"_. When we judge consequences, it is usually the impact of those consequences that we judge. For example, one consequence of increased greenhouse gases is increased global temperatures. The warming itself isn't worth judging, it is the flow-on effects (e.g. melting polar ice caps resulting in polar bear deaths).

Now we have a better framework for judging the bacon eater and the contributer to global warming. In the case of the bacon eater, what is the impact? A pig will definitely die, that is certain. But will her continued consumption cause the extinction of pigs as a species? This possibility is not even feasible; one could argue that her consumption increases the population of pigs as species due to consumer demand.
However, can we say the same of global warming? It is entirely feasible, even if the possibility is remote, that global warming could cause another Ice Age, causing the extinction of a plethora of species. So the impact of contributing to global warming could be considered less ethical than eating bacon.

## The worst best man

Brian is getting married in a few months and has asked Dave to be his best man. Brian chose to have the wedding on an island, which will be an expensive trip for Dave, too expensive for him to afford. Since Dave cannot attend the wedding, is he an immoral person?

This one is really one of the easiest to solve: _The less choice a person has, the more amoral the action_. 
Ethics is about choosing the correct path of action from the choices we have. If we cannot perform an action, the consequences of the inaction cannot be ours to bear.

## The healthy man and the unhealthy woman

Imagine the following people: 
- a 25 year old man chooses to get fit, by running around the block every day. 
- an elderly woman loses all her friends and family. Knowing she doesn't have a means to support herself she decides to commit suicide.

Both of these situations appear to have only personal consequences (no impact on other people), however one seems obviously more ethical than the other. Why?
